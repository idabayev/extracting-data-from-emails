# extracting-data-from-emails
Downloading pdf's from emails, reading and extracting data from them into tables

The module download_attachments.py can work independently. 
The code is mainly from the Gmail's API examples with some small changes from my behalf - https://developers.google.com/gmail/api/guides 

The other files are written specifically to the user's needs.
